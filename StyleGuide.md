# Style Guide
This Style Guide will outline guidlines for styling in the project to keep code and commits clean.
## Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- When only changing documentation, include [ci skip] in the commit title
## Coding Styles

- For indenting 4 spaces should be used
- Maximum 80 characters in a single line of code
- Functions should be less than 40 lines of code including comments
- Limit function parameters to three at most and use objects if more are needed
- Comments should be created, or changed when new code is written, or old code is changed 
- Never leave commented code in the codebase
- A line should break before binary operators
- Imports should be on separate lines
